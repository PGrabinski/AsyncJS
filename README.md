# AsyncJS
Private project: Asynchronous JavaScript

Presentation (in Polish) prepared in the flow of Mentoring Program at Univeristy of Wroc≈Çaw.
It gives a quick introduction to asynchronous instructions in JavaScript with simple and understandable code examples.

I hope to record it and upload it soon.
